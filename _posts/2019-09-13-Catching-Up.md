Catching Up...
=====
I have a bunch of projects that I completed for my Master's program that are worth posting...
Soon...
Some of it is already available at my [github...](https://www.github.com/chillington)

I did a climate change project...

I created machine learning algorithms in R without using pre-defined functions...

You've already seen my Practicum project by now, so I won't bore you with the details of my Artificial Neural Netowrk skills...

But I did create a very basic one from scratch (no Keras or equivalent), so I will post that...

Man, I have some work to do.
